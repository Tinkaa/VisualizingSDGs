# VisualizingSDGs
Get insights of how a country is doing on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), by comparing its values to other countries!

This visualization was created from the observation that there is a lot of mentioning about sustainable development and the SDGs, but people often don't really know how to interpret them.   
My aim was to make a visualization which makes people more conscious of the situation around the world and their position in it.     
From experience I believe that people are better at imaging someone else’s situation when they themselves are part of the story. This visualization uses this by placing the user’s situation relative to the rest of the world.  

As basis I use a map with all the countries. The user can then choose a country and a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Based on this selection, the score of the chosen goal 
(goal y) for each country, relative to the score of the selected country (country x) is 
shown, i.e. score_goaly_country - score_goaly_countryx.

The data being used can be downloaded from http://www.sdgindex.org/reports/2018/

The visualization can also be viewed online (might be slow), via https://public.tableau.com/profile/tinka2747#!/vizhome/Perspective_SDGs/Start
